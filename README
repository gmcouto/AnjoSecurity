=============================================================================
AnjoSecurity Plugin v1.0 (for Bukkit v0.1)
=============================================================================
Created by Gabriel Couto and AnjoCaido

This plugin is intended to help people while the server is in offline-mode. It
happens when minecraft.net. But it is a feature largely used on lan houses.

=============================================================================
REQUIREMENTES
=============================================================================
- Minecraft Server Beta 1.2_02
- Bukkit 0.1

=============================================================================
WHAT IT DOES
=============================================================================
It manages a user database with password, so users can protect their usernames
in offline-mode.

It stores hashed passwords in an SQLite database, to increase security, make
it easier to other plugins to access it and increase speed in big servers.

Every user that is registered on the server can do absolutely nothing, until
they log in with their passwords. This prevents people stealing loot and abuse
of other someone's permission rights.

=============================================================================
COMMANDS
=============================================================================
/register <password>
/login <password>
/reset <password>
/adminreset <username>

=============================================================================
OPTIONS
=============================================================================
When you first run the server with AnjoSecurity.jar, it creates a default
settings.properties file on it's default folder.

There you can translate messages, or set up some options, same as below:

1- opt-main-admins=AnjoCaido,gmcouto
this one means that AnjoCaido and gmcouto, while logged-in, can use
/adminreset to reset other people registration(*delete* registration)

2- opt-guests-resetatlogin=true
this enables that all guests(users not
registered) lose all their loot and get teleported to spawn at every login.

3- opt-guests-lockdown=true
this enables that all guest are totally
locked-down. just the same as they were registered, but not logged in.

4- opt-guests-summoncommands=true
this enables guests to use commands... just like /help and other things as
other plugins let them to. change true to false to make them not use
commands. (this can prevent new people on your server spamming commands while
no admin is connected)
